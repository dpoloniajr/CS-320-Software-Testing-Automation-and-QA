How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In order to make sure the code, program, or software is functional and secure, I ensure requirements are met, the quality of code is not overlooked, and use test coverage to confirm that everything that needs to be tested is being tested. Code should be simple, clear, and only include what is necessary, avoiding redundancy.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are gathered in the requirements stage. It can be one of the most difficult parts of the software building stages as creating software that does not meet the user's needs can prolong the project and go over budget. Software engineers need to determine what is the problem being solved and refine the requirements in order to incorporate them into a program.

How do I approach designing software?
In order to approach designing software, it is necessary, as stated above, to know what the user needs. Because the user may not know how to properly convey what they need, what the user requests may be different than what a project manager may interpret, which may then result in a different product than the user was expecting. The goal is for the expected value to equal the actual outcome obtained.
